      <p>The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was constituted by an Act of Parliament, the National Highways Authority of India Act, 1988. It is responsible for the development, maintenance and management of National Highways entrusted to it and/or matters connected or incidental thereto. NHAI enters into Concession Agreements for design, construction, operation and maintenance of highways by DBFOT Concessionaires. The Concessionaire builds NH stretches and during operation and maintenance of the said stretch collects and retains the toll (user fee). In case of stretches developed on Govt. / NHAI Funds, NHAI engages OMT Concessionaire / User-Fee Collection Contractors.
